# CKS-Challenges

This is a solution for the Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist Challenge Series from KodeKloud, 
which provides a comprehensive set of challenges designed to prepare Kubernetes professionals for the CKS certification. 
The challenge series test the skills and understanding of Kubernetes security concepts.

The challenges in this series cover a broad range of Kubernetes security topics, including network policies, RBAC, seccomp, AppArmor, and others. 

This solution series is intended for learning purposes only. It is assumed that you are familiar with the CKS exam and may need to refer to the 
challenges from [KodeKloud-CKS-Challenge]. If you're looking for additional resources to prepare for the CKS exam, 
it is recommended checking out the KodeKloud CKS resources available at [kodekloud.com]. 

To solve some of these tasks, I have make use of third-party security tools such as:

- [Aquasec Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/)
- [Kubesec](https://kubesec.io/)
- [CIS Benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/kubernetes/)
- [Falco from Sysdig open source](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/)

In addition, following resources were useful for completing these challenges:

- [Kubernetes Security Concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/)
- [Kubernetes Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
- [Kubernetes RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
- [Kubernetes Seccomp](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/clusters/seccomp/)
- [Kubernetes AppArmor](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/clusters/apparmor/)
